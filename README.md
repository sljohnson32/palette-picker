## Reflection

This was an individual project to kick off Module 4 at Turing School of Software & Design.  

This was my first project using Express with Knex and Postgres and I loved digging into these new technologies.  Everything came very quickly to me and I found writing tests to also be really quick and easy.  I now feel really comfortable with Express and server-side testing and am excited to expand my knowledge and experience in this area.

Coming into Mod at Turing 4 having spent a lot of time and energy focused on my React toolkit, having to build the front-end with vanilla JS and jQuery was challenging.  Not because I didn't understand the language and library, but because the design patterns are so different from what I had been using with React.  There is certainly refactoring I can do to my front-end code (this really wasn't my primary focus for this four day project) but it was a great experience to dig my head back into the fundamentals of vanilla JS and jQuery after not having used it for a while.
